###Week 1 Checklist

- [x] Eru - Create Github repository
- [x] Kyle - Familiarize yourself with AVC and C code, SSH into AVC
- [x] Deacon - Familiarize yourself with AVC and C code, SSH into AVC
- [x] Sian - Familiarize yourself with physical components of the AVC, plan how it will be assembeled
- [x] Sian - Familiarize yourself with physical components of the AVC, plan how it will be assembeled
- [x] Jon - Write week 2 goals, update readme, create Facebook group


###Week 2 Checklist

######Software
- [ ] Kyle – Go through Deacons code, checking for potential errors or bugs

- [ ] Kyle -Go through camera code, make sure it is commented. Consider how a camera would move the AVC and when it has varying readings such as half the picture being white for a corner, or the entire picture being white for crossroads, what happens when it hits a dead end

- [ ] Deacon – Go through Kyles code, checking for potential errors or bugs

- [ ] Deacon -Go through the motor code, making sure it is commented. Consider how it will change if one wheel is mounted in the opposite direction as the other. Setting a variable for the speed which can be changed or effected (later by IR sensors), what the robot will do if it runs into a wall or gate

#####Hardware
- [ ] Eru – Create a suitable design plan for the AVC with Sian, considering centre of gravity, how it will fit through the maze (approx 15cm’s wide). Plan how you expect us to use IR sensors, where they will be placed to get good readings

- [ ] Sian – Familiarize with CAD and 3d printing, create and work with Eru on design plans, plan what you think you will need to 3d print

######Paperwork
- [ ] Jon - Update the ReadMe, set week 3 goals


###Weekly Progress Checklist
- [ ] How has each team member performed against their goal set last week?
- [ ] Have you set a goal for each team member for this/next week?
- [ ] Has the team discussed which tasks are the most important or urgent?
- [ ] Do any team members need more help to complete their assigned task(s)?
- [ ] Have you updated the task list on Github this week?
- [ ] Are all relevant code, bot photos and design files on the team Github?
- [ ] Have you noted which members attended labs and team meetings?
- [ ] Have team members shared their draft report sections (if the team decided they wanted to do that)?
- [ ] Are there any tasks that need to be done for progress tp be made that have NOT been assigned to a team member?
