Every time a white pixel is found in this code:

nwp = 0;
value = get_pixel(i,56,3); // give each pixel in the array the pixel value of its location based on ' i '.
            if(value > 100){ // change 70 to actual white line value later
                white[i] = 1;
                nwp++;
            }
            else{
                white[i] = 0;
            }
            
if(nwp!= 0)
error/nwp;
