Every time a white pixel is found in this code:

nwp = 0;
value = get_pixel(i,56,3); // give each pixel in the array the pixel value of its location based on ' i '.
            if(value > 100){ // change 70 to actual white line value later
                white[i] = 1;
                nwp++;
            }
            else{
                white[i] = 0;
            }
            
if(nwp!= 0)
error/nwp;
else{
reverse motors
            
  Increase a variable "NumberOfWhitePixels

tutor help:
to differentiate between crossroad and just losing the line;
try this after it reverses, if all pixels are black, reverse, and if it sees white along the whole screen turn left.
but if its not white accross the whole screen, do PID
